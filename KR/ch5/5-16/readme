For a generic explanation of the approach taken, please refer to the readme file of exercise 5-14.
Assuming you've read it, we have to build two functions, dcmp, and dcasecmp. The first one is for normal case sensitive matching, the other one is case insensitive.
It basically consists of strcmp's implementation, but with a new pair of loops to ignore positions that are not blanks, digits or letters.
For the case insensitive match, we will convert everything to lowercase before comparing with the help of tolower() from ctype.h
