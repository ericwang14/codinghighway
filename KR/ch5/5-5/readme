Exercise 5-5
Write versions of the library functions strncpy, strncat, and strncmp, which operate on at most the first n characters of their argument strings.
For example, strncpy(s,t,n) copies at most n characters of t to s. Full descriptions are in Appendix B.

Brief explanation:
--
Read the appendix if you're not sure how the function is supposed to work in some cases.
This is an easy exercise, we just have to make sure to include the "at most n" condition in our loop tests. 
Note that, according to Appendix B:
	a) in strncpy, "at most n" includes the string terminator \0, so, if the limit is reached and \0 was not written, bad luck - whoever called it must be aware of that
	b) in strncat, at most n chars are copied, but s is always terminated with a single \0

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
