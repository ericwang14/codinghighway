Exercise 5-1
As written, getint treats a + or - not followed by a digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to push such a character back on the input

Brief explanation:
--
When we test whether c is '+' or '-', if the test succeeds, we will try and get another char. If it's a digit, we store it and we can go
out of the "if" block and continue with normal processing. If it's not a digit, we will signalize this by returning 0 and pushing back whatever was
read after the + or -. Note that we must do this in order to allow things like +-5 to be correctly processed.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c getch.c -Wall
