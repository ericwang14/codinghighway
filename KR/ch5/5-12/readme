Exercise 5-12
Extend entab and detab to accept the shorthand
	entab -m +n
to mean tab stops every n columns, starting at column m. Choose convenient (for the user) default behaviour.

Brief explanation:
--
The same approach as the exercise before is taken (using get_next_tab_stop). We will adopt the convention that before column m, there are tabstops every NDETAB (5) columns. This is the default behaviour
if no arguments are given.
This time, a new variable is needed to count the total columns read so far, so that get_next_tab_stop can know whether we passed column m. 
Remember that pos is always reset when a tab stop is reached, so we can't use it for that.

GCC command:
For entab, use: gcc -o entab entab.c -Wall
For detab, use: gcc -o detab detab.c -Wall
