Exercise 5-7
Rewrite readlines to store lines in an array supplied by main, rather than calling alloc to maintain storage. How much faster is the program?

Brief explanation:
--
This is a simple tweak. readlines must receive the array as an argument, as well as its size. We do not call alloc anymore, and if the number of lines is greater
than the array length received, -1 is returned.
We will also receive a new parameter as an argument that will be a big array where every line can be stored. This array can be a local variable in main, allocated in stack automatically, and passed
to readlines(). lineptr array will then make each position point to the appropriate position in this array where the line begins.
The code is faster because we do not use dynamic allocation, everything is allocated in stack because we're dealing with local variables.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
