Exercise 5-8
There is no error checking in day_of_year or month_day. Remedy this defect.

Brief explanation:
--
When you need to add error checking to a function, it basically means you have to look at the input arguments and imagine the most awkward, strange
values that someone could have passed it that would break your code. We will return -1 if we found an error.
In day_of_year, we have 3 parameters, and we implicitly expect it to obey to the following rules:
	a) year is a positive number
	b) month is something >=1 and <= 12
	c) day is > 0 and <= number of days of its own month
These checkings will make sure we will never index the array off its limits with mal-formed input.
As for month_day, we will change the return type from void to int, so that we can return -1 if an error was found.
This time, we expect the following conditions to be met:
	a) year is a positive number
	b) yearday is > 0 and <= 366 if it's a leap year, or 365 otherwise
	c) pmmonth and pday are not NULL-pointers

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
