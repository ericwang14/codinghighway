Exercise 5-10
Write the program expr, which evaluates a reverse Polish expression from the command line, where each operator or operand is a separate argument.
For example,
expr 2 3 4 + *
evaluates 2 x (3+4)

Brief explanation:
--
This is very similar to the RPN calculator developed before. This time we will parse the arguments using argc and argv.
Note that this method doesn't require the use of getch() and ungetch(), so it will be easier!
The program structure is the same, but getop() will now receive argv[i], and will only inform main() whether argv[i] is a number or an operation.
Note: When I tested this, I ran through a meticulous funny "bug". If you run this in bash shell (which is very likely), the operator * will not do what
you expect. This is because bash matches * as a wildcard for all the files on the current working directory. Very funny "bug", but it's not my fault. 
So, you have to escape * to use it in our RPN calculator (e.g., the example in the book becomes 2 3 4 + \*).

GCC command:
gcc -o solution getop.c main.c stack.c -Wall
