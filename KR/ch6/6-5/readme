Exercise 6-5
Write a function undef that will remove a name and definition from the table maintained by lookup and install.

Brief explanation:
--
To do this, first we have to call the hash function to determine the initial position in the array.
Then, we have to go through the list in that array position and search for the specific name.
Note that this is a single linked list, meaning we don't have pointers to the previous element. This means that we have to use 2
pointers in our function, one to the previous element in the list, and one to the current element. This allows us to easily remove
the name from the list by simply changing the previous element's next pointer to the next element of the current node. Also, after removing
pointer references, we are required to call free() for name, defn, and finally for the list member.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
