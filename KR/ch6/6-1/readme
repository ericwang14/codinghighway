Exercise 6-1
Our version of getword does not properly handle underscores, string constants, comments or preprocessor control lines.
Write a better version.

Brief explanation:
--
We will change the way getword() works. First, it will grab a character c. It will check if c is an alphabetic character, or _, or #,
in which case we assume that _ and # are part of the word, and we include all of those characters in the current word until something that is not alpha or _ read.
On the other hand, if the first char is not alpha, _ or #, we try to see if we're inside a string, in which case we include everything up to the next closing quote that is not escaped.
Finally, if nothing of the above happened, we check if we're inside a comment, in which case we recursively call getword() after skipping everything inside the comment. 
This causes getword() to completely ignore comments, as if they never existed in the first place.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c getch.c -Wall
