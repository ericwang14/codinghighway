Exercise 3-5
Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s. In particular, itob(n,s,16) formats n as a hexadecimal
integer in s.

Brief explanation:
--
This function works exactly the same way as the previous one, but instead of using modulo 10 arithmetic, we will be using modulo b.
However, we have to handle the case in which our current digit is greater than 9, to format it as a valid letter representation. So, we will assume that b is at most 36.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
