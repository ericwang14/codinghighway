Exercise 3-3
Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the
equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to
handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.

Brief explanation:
--
We will assume s2 holds enough space for the expansion of s1.
Our procedure will work as follows: we will store two indexes, one for the next position that is free for writing in s2,
another for the current processing position on s1. We start off by copying the first positon of s1 into the first position of s2.
Then, we initialize both indexes to the next (2nd) position on both strings. From now on, while we do not reach the end of s1, we will
go through this algorithm:
If the current position in s1 is a - and the previous position is a valid character and the next one is also a valid character, then,
for every character in between, copy it to s2, updating s2's current index.
Otherwise, copy the current s1 position into the current s2 position.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
