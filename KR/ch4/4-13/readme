Exercise 4-13
Write a recursive version of the function reverse(s), which reverses the string s in place.

Brief explanation:
--
This is very easy. We can define two argument parameters, left and right, that define the index of the 2 positions
that the current call should change. The idea is that to reverse a string with positions 0 .. n-1, we basically exchange
position 0 and n-1, and then ask the same function to reverse the string between positions 1 and n-2, and so forth, untill
the left limit is greater than or equal to the right limit.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
