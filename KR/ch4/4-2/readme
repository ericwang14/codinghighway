Exercise 4-1
Extend atof to handle scientific notation of the form 123.45e-6 where a floating-point number may be followed by e or E and an optionally signed exponent

Brief explanation:
--
This is a simple extension. When processing the float part of the number, if we read e or E, we will look for an optional sign (+ or -), store it, and then start
looking for the exponent value. We will use atoi logic to get our exponent value, and store it in a new variable. When we get to the end of the string,
if the exponent sign is negative, we execute power *= 10^(|exponent|). Otherwise, we do the same operation on val. This will ensure that if the exponent is negative, we will be
adding more decimal places by increasing the value of power, because we will be dividing by power in the end. The opposite happens for val.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
