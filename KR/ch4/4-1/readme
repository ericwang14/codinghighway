Exercise 4-1
Write the function strrindex(s,t), which returns the position of the rightmost ocurrence of t in s, or -1 if there is none.

Brief explanation:
--
This is pretty similar to the original strindex function shown before. However, instead of returning immediatly inside the outermost
for loop when we find a match, we simply keep looking for more matches untill the end of the string.
So, we will only be returning our result when the outter for loop is ended.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
