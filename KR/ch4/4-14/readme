Exercise 4-14
Define a macro swap(t,x,y) that interchanges two arguments of type t. (Block structure will help).

Brief explanation:
--
This is a simple macro definition. We will just declare a temporary variable of type t and swap x and y.
Note, however, that we must declare our temporary variable inside a block enclosed in braces. Otherwise, there
could be naming conflicts with possible variables in the current block with the same name. When you define macros,
you have to pay attention to these small details because you're not defining a function - you must remember that macros
are processed and replaced inline before the actual code is compiled.
We will call our temporary variable __z. It is not very likely that x or y are named __z in the program that uses this macro.
If that happens, the swap macro will obviously not work properly.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
