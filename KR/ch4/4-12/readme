Exercise 4-12
Adapt the ideas of printd to write a recursive version of itoa; that is, convert an integer into a string by calling a 
recursive routine.

Brief explanation:
--
The logic is the same. If there are still any leftmost digits, recursively call itoa with n/10.
If there are no leftmost digits, store n in the target string (this is where the recursion stops).
Our recursive itoa function will return the next element in the array where the previous caller can write.
As a consequence, the user will get the total number of chars printed.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
