Exercise 4-7
Write a routine ungets(s) that will push back an entire string onto the input. Should ungets know about buf and bufp, or should
it just use ungetch?

Brief explanation:
--
The purpose of writing getch and ungetch in the first place was to create a kind of layer abstraction between the rpn calculator processor
and the way that the input is handled. So, getch and ungetch define an abstraction layer that allows you go get the next input character, and
to unget some previously read character. That's all ungets needs - there is no reason for ungets to know about buf and bufp. It will merely
use ungetch() and hope that it works.
However, we have to keep in mind that the string must be pushed into the input in reverse order. This makes sense. When you read "hello" char by char,
you get h, e, l, l and o. It makes sense that getchar behaves in a FIFO manner, so, if you unget h, e, l, l, and o in order, if you call getchar() next,
you will get o, and then l, l, e, h. This means that we will have to insert each character in the string in reverse order back into the input.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
