Exercise 4-8
Suppose that there will never be more than one character of pushback. Modify getch and ungetch accordingly.

Brief explanation:
--
This is a very simple tweak. If there is at most one char of pushback, there is no need to keep buf and bufp. We just need
an external char variable to hold the pushback.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
