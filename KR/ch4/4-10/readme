Exercise 4-10
An alternate organization uses getline to read an entire input line; this makes getch and ungetch unnecessary. Revise the calculator to use this approach.

Brief explanation:
--
getch() and ungetch() are used by getop(). So, our rpn main function will be the same, but we will change getop() structure. Instead of reading char by char,
we will call getline() to obtain the whole line input and then process this line in a similar way as the old getop() version. Note that it is necessary to store
the current line index and the line itself in an external variable to preserve the value between calls.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution getop.c main.c stack.c -Wall
