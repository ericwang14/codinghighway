Exercise 1-12
Write a program that prints its input one word per line

Brief explanation:
--
We can use the word count program with a few changes. When we are in state IN and read a blank, then we print a newline before setting state to OUT,
because it means we just finished reading a word, so it's time to prepare for the next word by placing the cursor in the next line (we just want one word per line).
On the other hand, if what we just read is not a blank, then we're going to want to print it, because it means we're somewhere inside a word.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall

How to test:
cd tests
./runtests
If there's no output, every test was successfull.
