Exercise 1-12
Write a program that prints its input one word per line

Brief explanation:
--
The behaviour is very similar to the previous program. However, this time we will not need any additional variables. We just have to decide what to print after reading
the input.
If you're not used to escaping sequences, you might find them a little confusing in the beginning. Just remember that special characters are escaped with \, including \ itself, so if we want
to print a literal \, we have to pass \\ to printf. Therefore, if we want to print \\, we must pass \\\\ to printf.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall

How to test:
cd tests
./runtests
If there's no output, every test was successfull.
