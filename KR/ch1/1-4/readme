Exercise 1-4
Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

Brief explanation:
--
The program is exactly the same as the original one, except that it computes the temperatures the other way around.
We just have to make some math manipulation to end up with:
Fahrenheit = (9.0/5.0)*celsius + 32.0

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
