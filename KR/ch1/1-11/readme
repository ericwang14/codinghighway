Exercise 1-11
How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Brief explanation:
--
We can make a set of exhaustive tests to ensure program correctness. After testing the normal case, i.e., lines with sentences with more than 1 word,
we should also test some boundary cases. Boundary conditions are where normally you find bugs, since the human mind often ignores or forgets about
those cases and tries to find a general simple rule.
Boundary cases that can uncover some bugs are:
1. A line with only 1 word;
2. A line with no words;
3. A line with several words splitted by more than one blank (by blank I mean a tab or a space);
4. A line with no words and ending with EOF instead of newline;
5. A line with 1 word ending with EOF instead of newline;
6. A line with several words ending with EOF instead of newline;
7. A line ending with a blank before the newline character;
8. A line ending with several blanks before the newline character;
9. A line ending with 1 blank followed by EOF instead of newline;
10. A line ending with more than 1 blank followed by EOF instead of newline;
As you can see, there are multiple boundary conditions that can uncover hidden bugs.
The code provided in the book resisted all of those boundary cases. It looks like it is bug free.
