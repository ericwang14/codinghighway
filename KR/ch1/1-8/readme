Exercise 1-8
Write a program to count blanks, tabs and newlines.

Brief explanation:
--
We will have 3 separate counters - one for blanks, another for tabs and another for newlines.
Everytime we read a character, untill we do not reach the end of file, we just test it to see whether it is a blank, a tab or a newline,
and we increment the right counter in case one of these conditions is met.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall

How to test:
cd tests
./runtests
If there's no output, every test was successfull.
