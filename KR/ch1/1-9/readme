Exercise 1-9
Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

Brief explanation:
--
The function is simple: while the character read is a blank, just keep getting more chars. When the char returned from getchar()
is not a blank, we have to know if we saw a blank before. We will store that decision inside a variable. If we read blanks before, we print
a blank and the character returned. Otherwise, we just print the character.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall

How to test:
cd tests
./runtests
If there's no output, every test was successfull.
