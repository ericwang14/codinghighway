Exercise 1-18
Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

Brief explanation:
--
One approach would be to go all the way up to the end of the line, and then move backwards writing \n on every blank position untill find a character that is not a blank is found.
There is, however, a few extra unnecessary work with this: it is not needed to go all the way to the end just to go back again some positions. In order to avoid unnecessary work,
everytime we read a blank, we will update a variable i to the current position and keep on reading more and more characters untill eventually a non-blank or newline is reached. 
If newline was reached, then i will hold the index of the position that will now be the last one. Otherwise, we resume to normal processing.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
