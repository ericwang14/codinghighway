Exercise 1-22
Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program
does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.

Brief explanation:
--
For this exercise, we will have a buffer of size MAXLINE+2, where MAXLINE denotes the n-th column where a line will broken. The line is broken at most after MAXLINE characters, if there
are trailing blanks, the line will be broken after the last non-blank character that occurs before the MAXLINE'th column. Trailing blanks are ignored forever.
To do this, our buffer will hold the line characters read so far, and there will be 2 variables, pos and i, denoting, respectively, the next position to write in our buffer, and
the position after the last known non-blank character that was written to the buffer. The buffer is MAXLINE+2 long so that we have time to store \n and \0 in the worst case (when
MAXLINE characters have been read and there are no trailing blanks).
When newline is read or the buffer limit is reached, the buffer is terminated with a \n if it is needed, and finally with a NULL byte (\0). We then print this line.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
