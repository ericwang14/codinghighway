/* This is a sample comment. It spans lines
Did you know that tunefs manpage has a final sentence in bugs section
that says "You can tune a filesystem, but you can't tune a fish?
That's right. And more importantly, the source editor for that has a comment
that says:
"Take this out and a UNIX Demon will dog your steps untill time_t wraps around"
True story!
