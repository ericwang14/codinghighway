Exercise 1-16
Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

Brief explanation:
--
To do this, the getline function just needs to keep counting the chars untill the end, even if it reached the limit of the buffer (in which case it counts but it
obviously doesn't write the text to the buffer). In the end, we just have to return the total computed length, and print the returned value in the main function.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
