Exercise 1-6
Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.

Brief explanation:
--
To test this, we will just print the two possible values of the test, by setting a char to EOF and printing the test value,
and then by setting it to something else and printing the test value again.
When executed, the solution code printed: 
0
1
So, indeed, the value of the test is either 0 or 1.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
