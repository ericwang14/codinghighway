Exercise 1-13
Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal;
a vertical orientation is more challenging.

Brief explanation:
--
To do this, we need an array to store how many times an i-length word appeared in our input. We will assume there's a known upper bound MAXLENGTH.
So, the solution is to change the word count program to keep track of how many letters where read since the last time it entered the IN state.
When it is time to switch to OUT, we increment the value of the aray in the position refered by the length.
Because it makes no sense to count 0-length words, position i of the array will refer to the number of words with length i+1 seen in the input.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
