Exercise 2-2
Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or ||

Brief explanation:
--
The original loop was:
for (i=0; i<lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i) ...
If we don't want to use && nor ||, the only way to solve this is to make the opposite tests inside the body, and if one of the tests suceeds (meaning that the
original test would fail), we set some variable that will stop the loop.
Thus, the equivalent loop without && or || would be:
(...)
int can_continue = 1;
i = 0;
while (can_continue) {
	if (!(i < lim-1))
		can_continue = 0;
	else if (!((c=getchar()) != '\n'))
		can_continue = 0;
	else if (!(c != EOF))
		can_continue = 0;
	else {
		/* loop body goes here */
		i++;
	}
}
Note that the loop body must go into the final else clause, otherwise we would still execute the loop body when one of the tests fails for the first time.
The increment instruction, i++, must also be executed inside the else clause for the same reason.
