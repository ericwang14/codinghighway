Exercise 2-5
Write the function any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters
from s2. (The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the location).

Brief explanation:
--
We will use a similar approach to exercise 2-4. The first step will be to parse s2 and store each character that is in s2 in an array buffer.
Then, we will scan s1, and we return as soon as we find a character that is in our buffer.
The same issues wth signed and unsigned char machines arises, so we will use the same method that we used above to avoid trouble.
