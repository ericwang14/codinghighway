Exercise 2-10
Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower case, with a conditional expression instead of if-else.

Brief explanation:
--
This exercise follows a small introduction to a ? b : c conditional expression.
We will assume the input is well-formed, i.e., either it is an upper case character from A-Z or a lower case one from a-z.
This is a direct conversion from the function presented in page 43. Note, however, that this will only work for ASCII, as you hopefully read on page 43.
Portable versions of this kind of functions (upper, lower, isdigit, isspace, etc) are defined in ctype.h. If you want to learn more about it, read my article about
ctype.h at http://codinghighway.com/?p=307, or search for "ctype.h, gcc warnings, and other char issues" in my blog (codinghighway.com).

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
