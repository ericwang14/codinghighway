Exercise 8-8
Write a routine bfree(p,n) that will free an arbitrary block p of n characters into the free list maintained by malloc and free.
By using bfree, a user can add a static or external array to the free list at any time.

Brief explanation:
--
We can write bfree with the help of free. bfree will be responsible for checking if the new block has a plausible size, that is, if it's got enough
space to hold at least a Header element. If it does, then the new pointer's size field is initialized to the correct number of nunits, where nunits
is n/sizeof(Header), and then it calls free() to insert it in the free list. Simple and easy.
Our bfree function will return the new pointer stored, or NULL if it was discarded.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
