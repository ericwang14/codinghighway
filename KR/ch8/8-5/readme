Exercise 8-5
Modify the fsize program to print the other information contained in the inode entry.

Brief explanation:
--
This is an easy exercise. All we have to do is add a few more prints in the end of fsize() to dump some more of the fields
inside stat structure. I chose to print the inode number, the number of links to the file, and owner and group id.

A few important notes:
On my machine, there's no Dirent type, apparently, my operating system didn't make a typedef struct dirent Dirent. So I had to replace Dirent with struct dirent.
The final instruction in the function fsize (the printf instruction) throws a warning when you compile K&R's code with -Wall; it says that stbuf.st_size type doesn't match
the modifier %8ld, which is used for a long. Because stbuf.st_size is of type off_t, and thus implementation dependent, I simply casted it to long, and it worked on my machine, but
be warned that it may give some weird results in your machine. If it does, you might want to dig inside sys/types.h to figure out the real type of off_t. The same happens with the rest
of the information that was accessed as part of this exercise.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
