Exercise 8-1
Rewrite the program cat from Chapter 7 using read, write, open and close instead of their standard library equivalents. Perform experiments to determine the relative
speeds of the two versions.

Brief explanation:
--
This is pretty much the same cat program as defined previously in Chapter 7, except that filecopy now receives integers for the file descriptors, and the system calls
open, read, write and close are used instead of the equivalent standard library ones.
To use system calls, you have to make sure to include unistd.h, which defines the API of the operating system, if it is POSIX compliant. fcntl.h inclues the files manipulation
functions.
This version of cat is faster than the other that uses the standard library functions. You can read a detailed explanation about this in my blog at http://codinghighway.com/?p=620
(or search for "when stdio's getc() is slower than the corresponding syscall read()" in codinghighway.com).

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
