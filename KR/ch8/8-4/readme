Exercise 8-4
The standard library function
	int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int origin)
is identical to lseek except that fp is a file pointer instead of a file descriptor and the return value is an
int status, not a position. Write fseek. Make sure that your fseek coordinates properly with the buffering done for the
other functions of the library.

Brief explanation:
--
There really is nothing special about this. We just have to make sure to flush the buffer before seeking to another position in the file.
This is as simple as setting cnt to 0 and ptr to base if the file is in READ mode. If it's in WRITE mode, we call fflush to do the job for us.
After doing that, all we are left with is calling lseek.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
