Exercise 7-4
Write a private version of scanf analogous to minprintf from the previous section.

Brief explanation:
--
The code is similar to our minprintf version. We will only allow for modifiers %d, %f, %s and %c.
Note that the real scanf behaviour (as well as this minimal scanf behaviour) may seem a little tricky for those
who are new to using it. The book is not very clear on how scanf works. If you don't understand my implementation,
please refer to my article about scanf at http://codinghighway.com/?p=422 (or search for "scanf survival guide" in codinghighway.com). It's worth reading it!

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c getch.c -Wall
