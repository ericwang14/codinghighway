Exercise 7-6
Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.

Brief explanation:
--
Our program will open both files, whose name will be passed inside argv, and keep looping through every
pair of lines in the two files untill either one of the file reaches the end or a different line is found.
To capture the lines, we will use fgets function.
Note that this program doesn't care about blanks; if the first different line is an empty line in one file
(that is, a line consisting of the newline character only), the printed result will be difficult to understand
because the program will print an empty line.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
