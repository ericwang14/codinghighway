Exercise 7-1
Write a program that converts upper case to lower or lower case to upper, depending on the name it is invoked with, as found in argv[0].

Brief explanation:
--
This is easy. We just have to call the right functions according to the program name. Let's make the convention that if the program is named
"lower", we will output lower case chars, otherwise we will output upper case.
To turn this exercise into something a little more interesting, we will make use of pointers to functions. This allows us to test for the program name
once (in the beginning), to set the pointer to the right function, instead of having an IF inside the while loop.
We have to be careful with argv[0], because it will include the whole path used to call the program. We start scanning argv[0] from the end, untill either
we find a /, or the beginning of the string is reached (in which case there's no absolute path; meaning the current directory is probably in $PATH).

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
