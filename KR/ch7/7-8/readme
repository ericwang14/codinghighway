Exercise 7-8
Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for
each file.

Brief explanation:
--
This is an easy task. The program layout will be pretty similar to the one developed in the previous exercise, with the only
difference being in the equivalent of search_file. We will call it print_file, and what it does is it starts a new page count,
and prints every line in that file; the title will be "<FILE NAME> - PAGE <pageNumber>". I will assume each page can hold up to
PAGELIM (60 in my solution) lines.
The files names are passed as an argument to main().

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
