Exercise 7-3
Revise minprintf to handle more of the other facilities of printf.

Brief explanation:
--
The other facilities that are missing are:
	- minus sign
	- minimum field width, period and precision digit 
	- returning number of printed chars
	- Final "h" or "l" to indicate short or long digit
	- modifiers like p, c, u, g, e, x, o, ...
We will not care about h or l in the end for short and long, and we will not implement new
modifiers, such as p, e, u, etc., because they are only used for conversions.
minprintf is assumed to receive a valid fmt string. The facilities that were implemented in this exercise include left and right alignment with
the appropriate padding (padding is made by adding spaces), minimum width and precision, and returning number of characters printed.
Inside minprintf, we parse fmt, looking for precision, width and alignment modifiers. We then pass this to prettyprint, who uses
sprintf to make the necessary conversions and pads the output properly.

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
