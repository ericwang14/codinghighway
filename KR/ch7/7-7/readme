Exercise 7-7
Modify the pattern finding program of Chapter 5 to takes its input from a set of named files or, if no files are named as arguments, from the
standard input. Should the file name be printed when a matching line is found?

Brief explanation:
--
When reading from files provided as arguments, we definitely must print the file name (and line number) when a match is found; otherwise, the user would
have no clue whatsover where a match was found.
Our approach is similar to the one used in this chapter: if there are arguments, we use them to open the files. If there aren't, we just default to use the
input file stdin.
The progam is basically the same as the one presented in chapter 5, except that we need to use fgets instead of getline.
We will assume that the first argument is always the pattern to search for, optionally followed by the set of files to search.
For example, this:
find hello
Will print every line containing "hello" that is read from stdin.
This:
find hello temp.x program.c
Will find and print every line with "hello" in temp.x and program.c

GCC command:
gcc -o solution solution.c -Wall
