3.7.3
Write a "banner" function that is given a capital letter as input and produces as output an array of characters that graphically depicts that letter.
--
The best approach to solve this problem is to store each letter's encoding in an array that is indexed by letter number (assuming there are 26 upper case letters).
So, for example, "A" is letter 0, so the array must hold, in position 0, the representation of A. A can be graphically depicted like this:
                  
				  X
				X   X
               X     X
			  X       X
			 X         X
			XXXXXXXXXXXXX
		   X             X
		  X               X
		 X                 X
		 
We will store a multi-line character string with each letter's representation for each position of the array.
