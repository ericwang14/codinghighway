8.7.8
Modify Algorithm 3 (the divide-and-conquer algorithm) to run in linear worst-case time.

After reading this column, you're probably biased and brainwashed to think about the linear, simple non-recursive solution. It can be pretty hard to think outside of the box and change this recursive
algorithm to run in linear time.

I've devoted an entire article in my blog about it, you can read a fully detailed description of my solution at http://codinghighway.com/?p=850 (or search for "Programming pearls exercise 8, Column 8" at codinghighway.com)
