2.6.1
Consider the problem of finding all the anagrams of a given input word. How would you solve this problem given only the word and the dictionary? What if you could spend some time and space to process the dictionary before
answering any queries?

We will use the signature technique to identify the word. The signature is a sorted version of the word. If we can't preprocess the dictionary, there is nothing we can do besides iterating through every word and comparing
its signature to the word's signature.

Allowing a preprocessing step makes it easier because we could create a hash table indexed by a word's signature that stored a list of words that have the same signature. Thus, after processing the dictionary,
the word's anagrams would all be stored in the hash table position of the word's signature.
