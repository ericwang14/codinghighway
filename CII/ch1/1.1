getword increments linenum in <scan forward to a nonspace or EOF 6> but not after <copy the word into buf[0..size-1] 7> when a word ends at a new-line character. Explain why. What would happen if linenum were incremented in this case?

getword() makes sure to push back c into the input (as long as it's not EOF). This means that the next call to getc() will return this same character. 

This is needed because we can't know that we've read too much until we actually read too much. The first character in getword() that is not part of a word (that is, the character that breaks the loop condition c != EOF && !isspace(c)) is brought back to the input through ungetc(). This includes newline characters. Therefore, if a word ends with a newline character, linenum will be incremented in the next call to getword().

If linenum were incremented when a word ends with newline, then we would increment linenum twice for every word ending with a newline (assuming getword() is called subsequently), and we would mess up line counting. In particular, given that in a multi-line document, every line with at least one word includes one word terminating with newline, we would be stepping through lines 2 by 2.
